Technically, most narration is Hussie speaking, hence why I was reluctant to include it. This will only cover moments when Hussie's self insert *physically appears*, with a major exception being during the ever important Caliborn segments. Clarified because, while acting as the narrator, there are many moments when Hussie breaks character. Or. Er. Un-breaks not having a character. And begins talking through their in-universe OC, especially later on. So this will not have, say, Hussie trying to clarify that Slick's eye is plastic.
